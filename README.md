## About the competition  
A case study focused on the demise of Long-Term Capital Management. Teams evaluated the risk-based performance of the fund and its spectacular fall by issuing recommendations on many levels including trading, governance structure, and regulation and simulating an environment that included central clearing.

## Summary of our findings about LTCM
• LTCM’s models depended on unrealistic assumptions and focused on a short period of historical data. Its “diversified” portfolio was collectively exposed to credit, liquidity, and volatility risks.    
• Though LTCM was close to becoming insolvent, its desperate need for liquid capital to avoid defaults meant that it was suffering primarily a liquidity crisis.    
• Based on regression analysis, we find that the fund is vulnerable under stressed economic conditions, which may materialize during the current pandemic.  
• The absence of a CCP exacerbated LTCM’s liquidity strain, but its presence could not have saved the fund from the fundamentally flawed bets.  
• We recommend the fund to adopt a risk governance structure that includes a CRO and a Risk Committee, each endowed with sufficient supervisory power.
